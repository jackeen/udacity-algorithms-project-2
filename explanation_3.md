# Rearrange Array Elements

# Idea

According the requirement, the given numbers held in the array should be 
separate into two collections, these two sets' length must be equal or 
nearly equal. 

Supposing the length of given array is 'n', which is odd or even. When to 
iterate the array, the groups can be generated by the number's odd index or 
even index. This method can make sure that one group's items qual or just 
more than one than another group's items naturally.

In order to get the maximum number, the bigger digits are as high as possible 
in position of numbers. During iteration, the first digit picked up must be 
the biggest one of them. The next one is the second biggest one, and so on.

So, the array should be ordered from the maximum to the minimum at first. 

Due to reaching the required time complexity, O(n log n), there are three 
candidates, quick sort, merge sort and heap sort. 

In the worst case, quick sort needs O(n^2) to deal with the data, in this 
situation, it is not the best choice.

As for merge sort and heap sort, heap sort costs less space, so heap sort 
is better one.

In practice, it is not necessary to sort the array. The separating array 
process works as the priority queue based on heap, after an iteration, all 
digits are thrown into two groups (odd and even) respectively. 

Finally, the two groups' digits are combined to the two numbers, and their 
sum is maximum.

## Time complexity

The worst time complexity is O(n log n).

algorithms:
- heapify the given array, O(n log n)
- pop the maximum value one by one, O(n log n)
- translate the rearranged arrays into two number, O(n)

## Space complexity

The space complexity is O(n).

This extra space is costed by two group of digits which will be translated 
to the two numbers whose sum is maximum.
